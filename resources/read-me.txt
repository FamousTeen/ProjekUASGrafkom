Thanks for downloading this motion/pose data.

-> You are of course, free to edit the data for the sole purpose of having it fit your specific character models.
Prepare to do this anyway as there may be positioning differences from model to model. That's just how it is.
----> Note that for this data to work properly, it requires your models to have the Mother, Groove and Center bones properly set up.
----> There are plenty of tutorials on youtube that show you how to properly add these bones in PMXE. It's not very hard to do.

-> If you use this motion/pose data in any of your online creations please credit me: Hotaru7MMD

-> Please don't redistribute this, edited or not. Please link my original page that you downloaded this from instead
